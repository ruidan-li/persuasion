He took the position that they are unnatural. \\n\\nHe cited this definition by Merriam-Webster:  existing in nature and not made or caused by people : coming from nature (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural) as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural.\\n\\nHowever, I respectfully disagree with his position and furthermore that definition of natural. People arise from nature. Humankind\\'s capacity to create, problem-solve, analyze, rationalize, and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability, why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man, as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature, thus, how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature, I would understand the distinction between natural and man-made. However, I think unnatural and man-made are not synonyms by any means. It seems to me that man-made things MUST be natural due to our being part of nature. \\n\\nI would love to hear your arguments and to have my view changed if I am mistaken in my logic somewhere along the line.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for your responses lads. As many of you pointed out, our argument depends more on the context of the use of the word and I think that my friend and I were arguing about the semantics and definition more than our intended meaning behind use of the word \"natural\".',\n",

These types of hypothetical calculations aren\\'t really helpful, in my opinion.\\n\\nBut lets assume that more guns makes mass shootings less likely. Would this actually make a more heavily armed society a more polite one?\\n\\nI don\\'t think it would, because though premeditated murders could well be less likely, accidental deaths, unplanned homicides, and suicides would like increase. \\n\\nThis study found that owning a gun makes one more likely to die from suicide *and* homicide. Of course, that\\'s correlation, so there might be some third factor at play that makes gun owners more likely to b targets of crime or clinically depressed, but it certainly suggests that owning a gun doesn\\'t automatically make you safer.\\nhttp://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/10/929.full\\n \\nWhether or not more guns would prevent events like today\\'s isn\\'t the issue (though I am inclined to say they wouldn\\'t necessarily do that), it seems like a greater proliferation of weapons would be more dangerous for a number of other reasons.']"
