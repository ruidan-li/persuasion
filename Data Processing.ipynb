It is in Iran's best strategic interests to develop nuclear weapons in order to counter Israel (which has nuclear weapons), and additionally to one-up Saudi Arabia (their main regional rival), and guarantee their safety against other Arab nations with whom they have historically had rocky relations (Iraq, for example).\\n2. If Israel can illegally possess nuclear weapons (they haven't officially acknowledge they have nuclear weapons, nor have they signed the UN's non-proliferation treaty, making the weapons they do possess illegal), why can't Iran possess nuclear weapons, other than Western bias? Pakistan has nuclear weapons, and they are officially an Islamic Republic, and they can have nuclear weapons, even though their nuclear weapons are probably much more of a global security risk. \\n\\n3. Iran has proven itself to be a pragmatic and rational actor in world affairs. There is no reason to suspect that they would actually use a nuclear weapon, nor sell it to a terrorist group who would. They mainly want a nuclear weapon to secure their military position in the region, stick it to their rivals, and as a point of national pride. Because the West says Iran can't have a nuclear weapon, they want one all the more, and won't back down on that because of national pride, something an American should be able to sympathize with. \\n\\nNow, I recognize that Iran should not have nuclear weapons because it would cause an arms race in the most volatile region on Earth, but that doesn't mean that they, as a sovereign nation, do not have the right to develop a nuclear weapon. \\n\\n\",\n",
